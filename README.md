## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice using custom properties for colors and implementing hover and focus states for interactive elements. Here's an example of the hover effect I implemented:

```css
.social-links a:hover {
  background-color: var(--Green);
  color: var(--Grey-900);
  transition: color 0.3s ease;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility to ensure my projects are user-friendly across all devices.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand Flexbox better and apply it effectively in this project.
